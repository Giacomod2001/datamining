CV BUILDER - AI & MACHINE LEARNING MODELS EXPLAINED
===================================================

This document outlines the specific Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques used within the "CV Builder" module of CareerMatch AI to provide real-time suggestions and optimization.

1. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)
------------------------------------
Technique: Feature Extraction & Keyword Matching
Library: scikit-learn (implied via ml_utils), utilizing N-grams and Fuzzy Matching.

How it works:
- The system scans both your CV content (fields like Summary, Bio, Experience) and the target Job Description.
- It uses "N-gram analysis" (processing sequences of 1, 2, or 3 words) to identify technical terms (e.g., "Machine Learning", "Google Analytics 4") rather than just single words.
- It employs specialized "Fuzzy Matching" to recognize skills even if they are slightly misspelled or phrased differently (e.g., matching "React.js" with "ReactJS").

2. SMART MATCHING ALGORITHM
---------------------------
Technique: Jaccard Similarity Index (Set Theory)
Logic: Mathematical Set Intersection.

How it works:
- We treat the Job Description as a "Set" of required skills (Set A).
- We treat your CV as a "Set" of possessed skills (Set B).
- The "Optimization Score" is calculated using the Intersection of these sets divided by the Union (or the target set size), effectively measuring coverage.
- Score = (Skills in Common) / (Total Skills Required in JD).

3. ATS OPTIMIZATION ENGINE
--------------------------
Technique: Gap Analysis & Ranking

How it works:
- The system identifies the specific "Set Difference" (Skills in JD - Skills in CV).
- These missing skills are prioritized and suggested in the sidebar.
- This helps users "beat" Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) by ensuring the exact keywords filters are looking for are present in the document.

SUMMARY OF ARCHITECTURE
-----------------------
- Semantic Analysis: No (in this specific builder module, mostly keyword-based for precision).
- Vectorization: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used in the background to weight the importance of detected terms, ensuring "the" and "and" aren't counted as skills.

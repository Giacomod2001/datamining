🚀 **Introducing CareerMatch AI — A Smarter Way to Prepare for Your Job Search**

As part of my Data Mining & Text Analytics course at **IULM University**, my team built **CareerMatch AI** — an application designed to help job seekers understand their fit for specific roles before applying.

**The Problem We Solve:**
Job searching often feels like guesswork. You apply to dozens of positions without knowing which ones truly match your profile. Recruiters spend seconds scanning CVs — but what if you could see your CV through their eyes *first*?

✨ **What CareerMatch AI Offers:**

🎯 **Match Score:** Instantly see how well your CV aligns with any job description, with a clear 0-100% compatibility rating.

📉 **Skill Gap Analysis:** Discover which skills you're missing and should prioritize developing before your next application.

🔄 **Transferable Skills Recognition:** If you already know one tool, the system identifies related skills that are easy for you to learn.

🧭 **Career Compass:** Explore alternative roles that match your existing skill set — opportunities you might not have considered.

📝 **CV Builder:** Create optimized CVs with real-time suggestions tailored to specific job postings.

⚙️ **Under the Hood:**
The application leverages **Random Forest classification**, **TF-IDF vectorization**, **LDA topic modeling**, and **K-Means clustering** to analyze text and extract meaningful insights from **1,500+ skills** and **120+ job archetypes** in our database.

🔒 **Privacy by Design:**
Your data is never stored, collected, or used to train our models. Each session is completely independent — your CV stays yours.

Whether you're a recent graduate entering the job market or a professional exploring new opportunities, CareerMatch AI gives you clarity and actionable insights to make informed career decisions.
